# AOE Network

## What is AOE Network

AOE Network is a next-generation DeFi (distributed finance) project with DAO (decentralized organization) as the core governance method

## Our Vision

AOE Network is a next-generation DeFi project with DAO as the core governance method. AOE establishes a new deflationary model through smart contracts to ensure the stability of the value of AOE. Each transfer of AOE will Burning 5% of the total supply of AOE through smart contracts, as the total supply of AOE decreases, the total value of AOE can be continuously increased.

## How AOE value is guaranteed?

AOE establishes a new deflationary model through smart contracts to ensure the stability of the value of AOE. Every time you transfer AOE, it will be Burning 5% of the total supply of AOE through smart contracts, as the total supply of AOE decreases, the total value of AOE can be continuously increased.

## AOE Network Dapps

AOE Network has a functioning dApp built into the token smart contract, which is the Staking mechanism. Aside from that, two other dApps will be officially released by the AOE team which will include a hourglass staking system and a PvP DeFi dApp. Developers are also welcome to integrate AOE into their own applications or build custom ones.

## The DAO

Users who stake will qualify to receive DAO rewards. This incentive based system promote staking, reduces the amount of tokens in circulation and rewards users for their participation. Token holders will be able to vote using AOE on important advancements and platform progression. Decentralized voting will be vital to the overall health of the community and platform. The AOE DAO will also serve as a investment fund for external projects. This means that AOE can be used to help with initial start-up projects.

## What purpose does the DAO serve for AOE Network and its users?

The DAO makes AOE Network a decentralized organization. It gives ALL members of the DAO voting rights and incentives to utilize those voting rights. These votes are used to unlock funds, determine the direction of the project or suggest changes to the current structure. The investor aspect of the DAO allows users to determine which projects the organization would invest in and how much of those funds should be invested. More about the Investor DAO will be explained in the coming Litepaper.

## Why is there a cap on Deflation?

AOE Network is not just another run of the mill deflationary/staking project. The goal is to have AOE used as a digital asset and to be accepted as a form of cryptocurrency payment. Deflation and staking both end once 90% of the MAX supply is burned. This means that 100 Million AOE Network Tokens will be left.

## The Token
